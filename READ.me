My Portfolio

Im very new to coding but through the University of Washington coding bootcmap, I want to learn more about web development.
I hope to one day get my foot in at a entry level entry job and from there grow my portfolio with projects from the company and projects
that I do through learning websites because I beleive that there is still so much to learn from those sites even after accomplishing a bootcamp.
